RockPaperScissors
=================

Simple rock paper scissors game with pluggable AI behaviors

RPS.java handles interactions between the front end and AI.  
All that the AI has access to, is the history of moves taken each session.


Implement AI to create an AI that can be plugged in, put it in the package com.portalsoup.ai and declare it
in the constructor of RPS, add it to the list of available AI and give it a name that the user can type to switch AIs with.
